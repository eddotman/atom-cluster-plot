Atom Cluster Plotting Script
============================

Overview
--------

This script provides a package of functions that allow for the computation of local atomic motifs in bulk models (i.e. Cartesian coordinate sets) of amorphous atoms.

Usage
-----

This script was built to work with RMC++, but in principle, can work with any set of atomic coordinates.
