{"name":"atom-cluster-plot","tagline":"Visualization of atomic clusters in amorphous materials","body":"Local Atomic Motif Isolator\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis repo includes the `LAM` and `LAMisolator` classes, which allow for LAM isolation. The `LAMplotter` class contains some methods for computing histograms and plotting the density isosurfaces via the [Mayavi API](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/).  \r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou will need to have `numpy`, `scipy` and `mayavi` installed. Personally, I used [pythonxy](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads) for the aforementioned dependencies on Windows. If you're on Linux, I'll assume that you know how to `apt-get` or `pip`.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you must install [PeriodicCKDTree](https://github.com/eddotman/periodic_kdtree).  \r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBuild the `local_atomic_motif.py` file, to ensure that nothing crazy is going on. Depending on the permissions with which you run the script, you may want to manually add a `build/` directory to the same location as the LAM Python files.  \r\n\r\nNext, run the `local_atomic_motif_isolator.py`, followed by the `local_atomic_motif_plotter.py`. Do not be surprised by long runtimes.  \r\n\r\nThe `LAMisolator` and `LAMplotter` both include functions called `full_compute()`, which should work as-is.
